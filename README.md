# CPlusPlusProgram

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project was designed to help people that are not as comfortable using military time, or 24 hour time. It is a converter for a 12 hour digital clock
  and presents the 24 hour/ military time equivalent.

# What did you do particularly well?
  I felt that the design I used for the display was well designed, and i am most proud of that. The coding of the program is fairly simple but it is always nice to see your code     working.
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  the main enhancement I can think of would be adding a time keeping module that actually sets the time based on your time zone and keeps both the 12 hour and 24 hour clocks open 
  at the same time and in time with the current time. That aside I would also rework the display of the clock a little bit. As some of the numbers take more space than others the 
  design was skewed a little bit. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  creating the classes so that they talked to each other was probable the hardest part for me to code. I overcame these by googling and asking a friend who has experience for
  help in creating the program. my support network is a lot of notes everywhere. and adding to that is the list i have been creating that shows how each program calls for 
  something such as python calls a print by saying print("hello") and that is all. but with C++ you need to have #include<iostream> then cout << "Hello" << endl;   
  that is just one of the processes i have noted to help keep track of how to do what i would like for each language i have been learning.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  the main skill from this that will be transferable is the classes and ensuring the code will talk between classes. this will help me later on when i have to design something for
  a vetranarian that needs lots of things but they all center around pets (for example)

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  the easiest way to make a program readable is to add lots of in-line comments for the reader to be able to understand what is happening with what line of code. 
  it can still use a small block of code to one comment such as 
  // This loop is to add the numbers to a list
  for (I.........;
  is an example of a block that would only need a single comment.
  I always try to make the codes i write as easily maintainable as possible. this usually includes using functions or classes instead of "Hard Coding" the processes.
  i am not sure how adaptable my code is but i think everything else with maintainable helps a lot with the adaptability of the code.
